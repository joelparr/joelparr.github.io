A local collaboration between myself, Alex Roka and Anthony DeGennaro, for a while Wanderless was looking like an extremely promising alternative to the (at the time crappy) Do512. I provided a bunch of UX input and then built the entire site, including responsive CSS3, hand-rolled JS and an .NET MVC3 backend, powered by Cloud CMS Osmek. Unfortunately, whilst I remain proud of the design and dev work, the product end has floundered and the site is currently laying fallow. I'm hoping we can reboot Wanderless as we had a lot of plans for rolling out a bunch of exciting integrations and new functionality but obviously this is stalled now that content creation and product management has foundered.
