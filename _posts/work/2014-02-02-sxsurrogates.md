Another agency brand piece, this time for SXSW. Excuse the ramshackle back-end that is responsible for the awful load time and responsiveness that has progressively worsened since launch and eventual white elephant status. I worked alongside Gerren Lamson to realize his design, providing UX input and ultimately a responsive CSS3 and hand-rolled JS build for the project.
