Another UI design project from a couple of years back. I designed the logo/branding, the front-end marketing site and the back-end email marketing product UI (pictured in screenshots on Features page) - both of which were developed in-house. Again, aesthetically and UX wise this work now seems a little dated (we're talking pre-RWD days here really) and unfortunately hasn't been iterated upon to be brought up to today's standards.
