The front-end build consisted of taking Ridgewayâ€™s visual design and blowing out the look across a wide number of different content pages. Included in this was the interaction design and front-end development work associated with building a dramatic, full-width homepage carousel and a bold, slide-down vertically-displacing global navigation.

The back-end development was completed by Ridgeway using the KenticoCMS platform and was designed and built before the widespread adoption of responsive web design techniques.
