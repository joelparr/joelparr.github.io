Guestfolio is a GRM (Guest Relationship Management) company based in Canada that provides a number of different online services to the hotel industry. These include automated emails, surveys and newsletters along with their core product, an online, mobile-friendly concierge service for guests and an accompanying dashboard for hoteliers to manage the experience.

The team at Guestfolio asked me to help redesign their [hotel dashboard product](http://www.guestfolio.com/for-hotels/dashboard/), rethinking not just the aesthetics of the web application, but also the information architecture, user experience and layout.

The resulting design features “skinnable” elements that allow the data heavy website to be tailored to the individual hotel brands for each of Guestfolio’s clients. Featuring a clean, text-driven UI with graphical elements such as data-driven maps and graphs, my design concepts were taken on by Guestolfio’s in-house development team and applied to the core of one of their primary product offerings.
