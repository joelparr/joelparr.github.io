This is one of my UI design engagements from a couple of years back, and I feel this is inevitably reflected in the aesthetics of the work. I wasn't involved in the marketing site linked, but am responsible for the UI of the back-end client management dashboard system in the screenshots which was ultimately developed (and is still in use) in-house.
