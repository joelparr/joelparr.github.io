One of the later agency brand-pieces I worked on, alongside Maria D'Amato as designer. Another typical agency build with highly compressed timelines, a lot of content creation and finally the inevitable lack of follow-through from the stakeholders to keep the site maintained, iterated and a going concern! I collaborated on the UX and IA with Maria and ultimately did the responsive front-end build and back-end custom Wordpress theme and configuration.
