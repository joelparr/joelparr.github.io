I’ll keep this short and sweet—start the exact opposite of how I mean to go on. Consider this a welcome message, an introduction to a relaunch, or just a collection of words that nobody will ever read. It’s my umpteenth attempt to start blogging in the last 15 years and it’s got to start somewhere.

So welcome to my relaunched website. I hope you’re here because you’re looking to peruse my work. Or maybe you just clicked through from my Twitter bio. 

Either way, what I’m going to attempt to build up here are some thoughts on the web, design, photography and maybe revisit the idea of using this space as a repository for all the interesting bits-and-bobs I find on the Internet and ghetto away in Instapaper (previously in Delicious, before that in bookmarks menus, etc etc).

What I don’t imagine this will be is a frequently-updated river of content. But if it does, I’m not going to complain.
