				<h3 class="title personalities">Individualized Personalities</h3>
				<p>In game characters have very distinct personality quirks, they can be angered, flattered 
				and offended, make a ham-fisted offer and characters will refuse to deal with you. Knowing 
				when to cajole, flirt or bribe other characters will take finesse and a deft hand.</p>

				haggle to the cheapest possible price and make a purchase. Once bought, players then turn 
				around and locate someone else that is willing to buy the item for the highest possible 
				price.</p>
